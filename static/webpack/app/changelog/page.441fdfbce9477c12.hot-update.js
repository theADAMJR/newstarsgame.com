Reduction in monthly lag spikes with parallel optimization for AI, and saving.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Optimized\\r\\n- Optimize: Saving System -> Parallel optimization for saving, eliminating lag spikes from saving/auto-saving.\\r\\n- Optimize: AI -> Parallel optimization for AI starbase, and diplomacy handling.\\r\\n  - Diplomacy handling was the laggiest part of the AI.\\r\\n  - Foundation added for further AI optimization.\\r\\n  - There should now be a noticable reduction in monthly lag spikes.\\r\\n- Optimize: Events -> Some non-critical events are no longer received, especially when the player is not involved, preventing lag.\\r\\n  - Updates affected include: relations changed, colony orders, starbase orders, and fleet orders.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Improved\\r\\n- Improve: Tooltip -> Right-click to toggle pin tooltips in place.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Animated Combat -> Ship movement was too slow when moving towards the target.\\r\\n- Fix: Animated Combat -> Temporary workaround to allow random turrets to fire visually to fix turrets not appearing to fire when expected.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Ships spawn out of bounds, on saves before `v1.3.0`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changed\\r\\n- Change: Colony -> Now uses ID of colony number, not parent system ID in saves.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tweaked\\r\\n- Tweak: Galaxy -> Increase galaxy visuals scale for duel map size.\\r\\n- Tweak: Main Menu -> Scroll sensitivity of create empire/map increased.\\r\\n- Tweak: Camera -> Increase movement speed in ubiquity system by `1.5x`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Balanced\\r\\n- Balance: Tech -> Repeatable starbase capacity techs now give `+2` instead of `+1` designation slots.\\r\\n- Balance: Occupation Cost -> Reduced base cost of occupation from `1` to `.5` per occupied starbase.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Behind the Scenes\\r\\n- Addition of e2e tests to improve stability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Note\\r\\n- Save files before v1.3.0 (12th January 2024) previously have loaded fleets out of bounds, due to star system rescaling, but are now repositioned within the boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.4.0 'META' [25.01.2024]\\r\\n> Pushing previous beta update to all users.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.4.0-prerelease 'META' [22.01.2024]\\r\\n> More optimizations, new galaxy sizes, and provisional removal of half-added features.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Added\\r\\n- Add: Map -> Map -> Duel map size - 50 stars galaxy.\\r\\n- Add: Create Map -> Option to select duel stars galaxy map.\\r\\n- Add: Create Map -> Recommended settings for duel stars galaxy map such as player count etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Optimized\\r\\n- Optimize: Resource Manager -> Reworked to use multithreading for most monthly resource calculations.\\r\\n- Optimize: Pathfinding -> Reworked to use multithreading for calculating routes, to reduce lag spikes.\\r\\n- Optimize: Fleet -> Eliminated large lag spikes when moving fleets (on modern CPUs).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Start Game -> Does not open Ubiquity and spawns in the center of galaxy.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Regular starbase labels appear huge.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changed\\r\\n- Change: Resource Manager -> Space entity players no longer have resource calculations, reducing lag.\\r\\n- Change: Map Generator -> Star counts for each map size are now `100`, `150`, `200`, `250`, `300` instead of `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500` for new games.\\r\\n  - 400-500 stars is impractically large.\\r\\n  - Double the smallest map size is too large of an increment.\\r\\n  - Galaxy visuals were generally poor on map sizes of >300 stars.\\r\\n  - Loading saves from old map sizes has been tested to work as normal.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Removed\\r\\n- Remove: Celestial Squid -> No longer spawns in galaxy, because it is currently too broken.\\r\\n  - The celestial squid may appear again when more bug fixes and polishes have been done.\\r\\n- Remove: Blue galaxy smoke from gold galaxy.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.3.1 'META' [17.01.2024]\\r\\n> Experimenting with running monthly calculations on multiple threads, to reduce lag spikes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Pop manager -> Population of clans does not increase.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Opening a system is very laggy from new ship pathfinding system.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Optimized\\r\\n- Optimize: Pop manager -> Reworked to use multithreading for colony population calculations, which should slightly reduce monthly update lag.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.3.0-prerelease 'META' [12.01.2024]\\r\\n> Total redesign of ship movement, and rescaling of ubiquity star systems, focusing on fixing pathfinding bugs.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Ships often get stuck around planets, or struggle to move around them, especially during battles.\\r\\n- Fix: Loading screen -> Some text appears to overflow their backgrounds.\\r\\n- Fix: Combat system -> Ships collide with each other in combat.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Space squids -> Beelines into planet roundabouts (so does fleet ubi position).\\r\\n- Fix: Xeno Exterminator -> Raze Colony -> Multiple raze orders can be queued.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tweaked\\r\\n- Tweak: Ubiquity -> Systems now always spawn at 0,0 instead of at a slight offset.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changed\\r\\n- Change: Ubiquity -> Reduced size of star systems by 10x [due to limitations with new pathfinding system].\\r\\n- Change: Ubiquity -> Starbases of unknown players no longer have empty HUDs.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Note\\r\\n> Following the post-release updates, there is a need for more careful and slower updates, like this one, deployed to the beta branch first.\\r\\n> This update was delayed by a few days, since it was a huge rework and introduced many bugs that were internally fixed [20+ internally fixed bugs are omitted from the changelog].\\r\\n\\r\\n*This will likely introduce some bugs I have not found, so the update will be deployed on the beta branch first to gather feedback. Sometimes a step backwards is required to take 2 steps forward.*\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.2.4 'META' [05.01.2024]\\r\\n> Hotfix for colony siege not triggering, and some other fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Colony -> Siege -> Colony siege is sometimes not triggered [due to an issue with new fleet stats].\\r\\n    - This bug appeared after the previous update which modified siege calculations.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Fleet -> After opening a system, fleets initially don't appear in fleet formation and appear inside each other.\\r\\n- Fix: Load save -> From in-game -> Fog of war duplicates and is not cleaned up [behind the scenes] when loading a save, which may cause memory issues.\\r\\n- Fix: Load save -> Sometimes shows galactic core is visible at first in the initial star system.\\r\\n- Fix: Load save -> From in-game -> Empire borders are not cleaned up [behind the scenes] when loading a save, which may cause memory issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.2.3 'META' [05.12.2024]\\r\\n> The first update of 2024. A step towards making the game stable.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Improved\\r\\n- Improve: Diplomacy panel -> Agreements -> Show if we grant the other empire border access.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Endgame screen -> Does not auto-pause time and allows controlling time while open.\\r\\n- Fix: Endgame screen -> Scrollbar does not work and appears duplicated.\\r\\n- Fix: Colony siege -> If nobody is enforcing siege, it should auto reduce.\\r\\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Opens with the previous ship that was loaded automatically instead of unlocked preset.\\r\\n- Fix: Colony panel -> Build queue is not visible when viewing an unoccupied enemy colony, when the starbase is occupied by self.\\r\\n- Fix: Colony siege -> Civilian ships should not progress siege.\\r\\n    - Siege progress is now determined by base damage, as opposed to ship strength.\\r\\n- Fix: Cross-scene -> Music button -> Tooltip starts off as empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.2.2 'META' [31.12.2023]\\r\\n> The last update of 2023, focusing mainly on ship fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Simulate combat -> Turrets do not shoot.\\r\\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Simulate combat -> Turrets continue firing when the target is out of range.\\r\\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Combat mode -> Turrets fire at rapid speed when engaged.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Combat -> Ship continues to shoot when paused (shooting ignores time scale).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Improved\\r\\n- Improve: Ship builder -> Use gradient skybox instead of image background.\\r\\n- Improve: Ship builder -> Add text to indicate turret range.\\r\\n- Improve: Ship builder -> Target should move in and out to engage turrets at different ranges.\\r\\n- Improve: Fog of war (FOW) -> Restore previous smooth fog of war (as shown in early-access post cover screenshot).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.2.1 'META' [29.12.2023]\\r\\n> Bug fixes, especially with the main menu.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Skyboxes -> Appear lower quality on build due to unnecessary mip maps.\\r\\n- Fix: Main menu -> Origin selection -> Origin description text is not legible enough, requiring cybernetic eyesight to read.\\r\\n- Fix: Main menu -> Selecting empire icon and hovering over other input breaks preview icon.\\r\\n- Fix: Pause menu -> Game settings were not applied correctly.\\r\\n- Fix: Battle -> Retreat -> Does not work with new combat system.\\r\\n- Fix: Start game -> Does not start with gunboat.\\r\\n- Fix: Main menu -> Play -> Huge memory usage on 4K resolutions.\\r\\n- Fix: Open galaxy map -> Borders initially do not have correct colours.\\r\\n- Fix: Fleet -> Starter ships don't match preset ships.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Removed\\r\\n- Remove: Main menu -> Ubiquity inspector -> Replaced 3D planet models with images of planet surface as it caused memory issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.2.0 'META' [28.12.2023]\\r\\n> Backend simulated combat improvements, and animated combat fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Added\\r\\n- Add: Solace ship builder -> Evasion stat into stats UI.\\r\\n- Add: Combat system -> Use Solace turrets to deal damage in the backend.\\r\\n- Add: Combat -> Min and max turret ranges.\\r\\n- Add: Combat -> Rate of fire per turret.\\r\\n- Add: Solace ship builder -> Rate of fire to turret stats.\\r\\n- Add: Pause menu -> Open credits button.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Improved\\r\\n- Improve: Ship Builder -> Turrets -> Should have stats on screen, instead of tooltip [for clarity].\\r\\n\\r\\n### Balanced\\r\\n- Balance: Colonist -> Reduced from `75` to `45` power cost on standard speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Background has tiling artifacts on ultrawide displays.\\r\\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> When fleet types are unlocked, filter type UI does not update after opening the ship builder.\\r\\n- Fix: Pause menu -> 'New stars satellites' logo sometimes appeared duplicated.\\r\\n- Fix: Credits -> Credits username appears in broken font.\\r\\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Panels remain open when opened.\\r\\n- Fix: Starbase panel -> Upgrade button tooltip showed technological advance required when can upgrade starbase.\\r\\n- Fix: Pause menu -> Game settings info is not fully visible on ultrawide aspect ratio.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How Turret Ranges Currently Work\\r\\n- When combat is being observed, accurate turret ranges are used from the animated ship position, otherwise if a star system is not open, turret range is based on the center of the fleet.\\r\\n- This is because ship positions are not known by the server, only the client, as simulating positions on the server would be more difficult and require more CPU calls.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Note: This combat update requires more work such as bug fixes/balancing/playtesting, but is functional, so will first be pushed to the beta branch.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.1.0 'META' [23.12.2023]\\r\\n> Rebranding of main menu back to the original, and fixing of remaining known saving system bugs.\\r\\n\\r\\n###

Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Load game -> Map does not generate correctly -> \\\"Saved games will not work\\\" -> The game was not generating the correct map size to load the save from.\\r\\n- Fix: Load save -> Resource counts do not always update and show negative values.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1.0.5 'META' [22.12.2023]\\r\\n> Bug fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Colony -> Planet composed entirely of farmers is not producing enough food.\\r\\n- Fix: Colony -> Population does not grow with 0 food, even though it is not starving.\\r\\n- Fix: Star system -> Cannot colonize void world if a

fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Possible Fix\\r\\n- Possible Fix: Crashing bug after playing game for \\\"half an hour\\\", then game does not re-open (may be device-specific).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Fixed\\r\\n- Fix: Create empire -> Empire name and colours are randomly changed when creating a game -> \\\"Unable to choose EU flag background colour as primary colour.\\\"\\r\\n    - Also added official EU colours to colour picker.\\r\\n- Fix: Animated combat -> Hyper-janky turrets when time is at 2x speed (turrets fire extremely fast).\\r\\n    - Now turret firing speed is constant on all timescales.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Planet name appears in tooltip instead of \\\"Unknown\\\" for unknown systems.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Having around 20 ships in one system causes lag spikes every in-game day [optimize].\\r\\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Hologram turrets are not affected by master volume or ambient volume.\\r\\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Ships often jump around when moving, especially in animated

Fix: Occupy colony -> Sets colony of `22` population to `1`.\\r\\n- Fix: Settings -> Vsync is not applied in-game when set in main menu.\\r\\n- Fix: Animated combat -> Beam turrets beams are not visible.\\r\\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Ship stats -> Some costs overflowed the ship stats UI.\\r\\n- Fix: Fleet panel -> Fleet capacity for civilian ships (i.e., builders) shows 2/1.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Improved\\r\\n- Improve: Ubiquity -> Hyperlane -> Improve tooltip to indicate whether borders are closed or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tweaked\\r\\n- Tweak: Game events -> Colony dangerous wildlife -> First option gives 120 instead of 100 food on standard speed.\\r\\n- Tweak: Ion flux -> Changed icon for turret to not be a duplicate of ion stream.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n##
