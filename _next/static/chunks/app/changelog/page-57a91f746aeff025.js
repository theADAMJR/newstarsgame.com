Changelog. -->\r\n<!-- Copyright \xa9 2023 adamjr. All rights reserved. -->\r\n<!-- Note: This changelog is a development preview and may not reflect the final state of the game. -->\r\n\r\n## 1.3.0 'META' [12.01.2024]\r\n> Total redesign of ship movement, and rescaling of ubiquity star systems.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Ships often get stuck around planets, or struggle to move around them, especially during battles.\r\n- Fix: Loading screen -> Some text appears to overflow their backgrounds.\r\n- Fix: Combat system -> Ships collide with each other in combat.\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Space squids -> Beelines into planet roundabouts (so does fleet ubi position).\r\n- Fix: Xeno Exterminator -> Raze Colony -> Multiple raze orders can be queued.\r\n\r\n### Tweaked\r\n- Tweak: Ubiquity -> Systems now always spawn at 0,0 instead of at a slight offset.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Change: Ubiquity -> Reduced size of star systems by 10x [due to limitations with new pathfinding system].\r\n- Change: Ubiquity -> Starbases of unknown players no longer have empty HUDs.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n> Following the post-release updates, there is a need for more careful and slower updates, like this one, deployed to the beta branch first.\r\n> This update was delayed by a few days, since it was a huge rework and introduced many bugs that were internally fixed [20+ internally fixed bugs are omitted from the changelog].\r\n\r\n*This will likely introduce some bugs I have not found, so the update will be deployed on the beta branch first to gather feedback. Sometimes a step backwards is required to take 2 steps forward.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.2.4 'META' [05.01.2024]\r\n> Hotfix for colony siege not triggering, and some other fixes.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Colony -> Siege -> Colony siege is sometimes not triggered [due to an issue with new fleet stats].\r\n    - This bug appeared after the previous update which modified siege calculations.\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Fleet -> After opening a system, fleets initially don't appear in fleet formation and appear inside each other.\r\n- Fix: Load save -> From in-game -> Fog of war duplicates and is not cleaned up [behind the scenes] when loading a save, which may cause memory issues.\r\n- Fix: Load save -> Sometimes shows galactic core is visible at first in the initial star system.\r\n- Fix: Load save -> From in-game -> Empire borders are not cleaned up [behind the scenes] when loading a save, which may cause memory issues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.2.3 'META' [05.12.2024]\r\n> The first update of 2024. A step towards making the game stable.\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n- Improve: Diplomacy panel -> Agreements -> Show if we grant the other empire border access.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Endgame screen -> Does not auto-pause time and allows controlling time while open.\r\n- Fix: Endgame screen -> Scrollbar does not work and appears duplicated.\r\n- Fix: Colony siege -> If nobody is enforcing siege, it should auto reduce.\r\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Opens with the previous ship that was loaded automatically instead of unlocked preset.\r\n- Fix: Colony panel -> Build queue is not visible when viewing an unoccupied enemy colony, when the starbase is occupied by self.\r\n- Fix: Colony siege -> Civilian ships should not progress siege.\r\n    - Siege progress is now determined by base damage, as opposed to ship strength.\r\n- Fix: Cross-scene -> Music button -> Tooltip starts off as empty.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.2.2 'META' [31.12.2023]\r\n> The last update of 2023, focusing mainly on ship fixes.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Simulate combat -> Turrets do not shoot.\r\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Simulate combat -> Turrets continue firing when the target is out of range.\r\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Combat mode -> Turrets fire at rapid speed when engaged.\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Combat -> Ship continues to shoot when paused (shooting ignores time scale).\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n- Improve: Ship builder -> Use gradient skybox instead of image background.\r\n- Improve: Ship builder -> Add text to indicate turret range.\r\n- Improve: Ship builder -> Target should move in and out to engage turrets at different ranges.\r\n- Improve: Fog of war (FOW) -> Restore previous smooth fog of war (as shown in early-access post cover screenshot).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.2.1 'META' [29.12.2023]\r\n> Bug fixes, especially with the main menu.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Skyboxes -> Appear lower quality on build due to unnecessary mip maps.\r\n- Fix: Main menu -> Origin selection -> Origin description text is not legible enough, requiring cybernetic eyesight to read.\r\n- Fix: Main menu -> Selecting empire icon and hovering over other input breaks preview icon.\r\n- Fix: Pause menu -> Game settings were not applied correctly.\r\n- Fix: Battle -> Retreat -> Does not work with new combat system.\r\n- Fix: Start game -> Does not start with gunboat.\r\n- Fix: Main menu -> Play -> Huge memory usage on 4K resolutions.\r\n- Fix: Open galaxy map -> Borders initially do not have correct colours.\r\n- Fix: Fleet -> Starter ships don't match preset ships.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- Remove: Main menu -> Ubiquity inspector -> Replaced 3D planet models with images of planet surface as it caused memory issues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.2.0 'META' [28.12.2023]\r\n> Backend simulated combat improvements, and animated combat fixes.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Add: Solace ship builder -> Evasion stat into stats UI.\r\n- Add: Combat system -> Use Solace turrets to deal damage in the backend.\r\n- Add: Combat -> Min and max turret ranges.\r\n- Add: Combat -> Rate of fire per turret.\r\n- Add: Solace ship builder -> Rate of fire to turret stats.\r\n- Add: Pause menu -> Open credits button.\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n- Improve: Ship Builder -> Turrets -> Should have stats on screen, instead of tooltip [for clarity].\r\n\r\n### Balanced\r\n- Balance: Colonist -> Reduced from `75` to `45` power cost on standard speed.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Ship builder -> Background has tiling artifacts on ultrawide displays.\r\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> When fleet types are unlocked, filter type UI does not update after opening the ship builder.\r\n- Fix: Pause menu -> 'New stars satellites' logo sometimes appeared duplicated.\r\n- Fix: Credits -> Credits username appears in broken font.\r\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Panels remain open when opened.\r\n- Fix: Starbase panel -> Upgrade button tooltip showed technological advance required when can upgrade starbase.\r\n- Fix: Pause menu -> Game settings info is not fully visible on ultrawide aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n### How Turret Ranges Currently Work\r\n- When combat is being observed, accurate turret ranges are used from the animated ship position, otherwise if a star system is not open, turret range is based on the center of the fleet.\r\n- This is because ship positions are not known by the server, only the client, as simulating positions on the server would be more difficult and require more CPU calls.\r\n\r\n> Note: This combat update requires more work such as bug fixes/balancing/playtesting, but is functional, so will first be pushed to the beta branch.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.1.0 'META' [23.12.2023]\r\n> Rebranding of main menu back to the original, and fixing of remaining known saving system bugs.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Changed: Replaced November 2023 3D main menu background with July 2022 parallax background.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Load save -> From in-game -> Empire borders don't respawn.\r\n- Fix: Load save -> In-game -> Does not restore icons, etc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.0.6 'META' [23.12.2023]\r\n> Fixing saving system bugs players encountered.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Load game -> Map does not generate correctly -> \"Saved games will not work\" -> The game was not generating the correct map size to load the save from.\r\n- Fix: Load save -> Resource counts do not always update and show negative values.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.0.5 'META' [22.12.2023]\r\n> Bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Colony -> Planet composed entirely of farmers is not producing enough food.\r\n- Fix: Colony -> Population does not grow with 0 food, even though it is not starving.\r\n- Fix: Star system -> Cannot colonize void world if a broken world is spawned before it.\r\n\r\n### Balanced\r\n- Balance: Colony -> Capital buildings now produce 2 energy to offset deficits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.0.4 'META' [22.12.2023]\r\n> More fixes and UI tweaks.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Add: Bug reporting interface -> Save files are now sent with bug reports, to make it easier to reproduce bugs.\r\n\r\n### Possible Fix\r\n- Possible fix: Game -> Game boots into windowed mode by default (default was set to windowed and 720p in player settings).\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Create subject -> Does not update empire borders.\r\n- Fix: Bug reporting interface -> Send button was missing tooltip info.\r\n- Fix: Subject -> Subjects should join union when overlord forms union, as they are still subjects.\r\n- Fix: Main menu -> Loading screen, load menu, etc., were not visible when opened.\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n- Improve: Colony panel -> Updated summary icons.\r\n\r\n### Tweaked\r\n- Tweak: Game event -> Colony extreme polar regions -> First option now gives `90` science instead of `100`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.0.3 'META' [21.12.2023]\r\n> Some fixes.\r\n\r\n### Possible Fix\r\n- Possible Fix: Crashing bug after playing game for \"half an hour\", then game does not re-open (may be device-specific).\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Create empire -> Empire name and colours are randomly changed when creating a game -> \"Unable to choose EU flag background colour as primary colour.\"\r\n    - Also added official EU colours to colour picker.\r\n- Fix: Animated combat -> Hyper-janky turrets when time is at 2x speed (turrets fire extremely fast).\r\n    - Now turret firing speed is constant on all timescales.\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Planet name appears in tooltip instead of \"Unknown\" for unknown systems.\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Having around 20 ships in one system causes lag spikes every in-game day [optimize].\r\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Hologram turrets are not affected by master volume or ambient volume.\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> Ships often jump around when moving, especially in animated combat, especially at 2x time speed [happens after winning battle].\r\n- Fix: Animated combat -> Ships continue shooting after destroyed.\r\n- Fix: Silent state -> Stealth fleets should not meet players in system.\r\n- Fix: Ubiquity -> When move fleet into Ubiquity hyperlane that is neutral, war confirmation does not show, leading to nothing happening.\r\n- Fix: Fleet panel -> Fleet capacity UI adds up ship count instead of ship size.\r\n- Fix: Game event panel -> Selecting option is not disabled when reopening the ping, allowing options to be selected multiple times.\r\n- Fix: Occupy colony -> Sets colony of `22` population to `1`.\r\n- Fix: Settings -> Vsync is not applied in-game when set in main menu.\r\n- Fix: Animated combat -> Beam turrets beams are not visible.\r\n- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Ship stats -> Some costs overflowed the ship stats UI.\r\n- Fix: Fleet panel -> Fleet capacity for civilian ships (i.e., builders) shows 2/1.\r\n\r\n### Improved\r\n- Improve: Ubiquity -> Hyperlane -> Improve tooltip to indicate whether borders are closed or not.\r\n\r\n### Tweaked\r\n- Tweak: Game events -> Colony dangerous wildlife -> First option gives 120 instead of 100 food on standard speed.\r\n- Tweak: Ion flux -> Changed icon for turret to not be a duplicate of ion stream.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.0.2 'META' [21.12.2023]\r\n> Some fixes addressing issues with screen resolution, and other suggestions.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Add: Settings -> Change screen resolution.\r\n- Ensure to reset Steam launch options that override resolution, or they may cause issues.\r\n- The in-game resolutions are:\r\n    - Initial screen resolution\r\n    - 3840x2160\r\n    - 2560x1400\r\n    - 1920x1080\r\n    - 1280x720\r\n- Add: Solace Ship Builder -> Tooltip for weapon stats in ship builder.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Settings -> Anti-aliasing -> Selector has no effect on anti aliasing.\r\n- Fix: Solace Ship Builder -> Lens buttons overlay obstructs preset management UI.\r\n- Fix: Loading Screen -> Shows black borders on top and bottom of the screen on some resolutions.\r\n- Fix: Built -> Planet visuals -> Lower quality in built game as textures are set to low, but not updated automatically in graphics manager.\r\n- Fix: Cross-scene -> Sometimes random empire borders are sometimes spawned in wrong places (fixed in previous update).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1.0.1 'META' [20.12.2023]\r\n> Hotfix partially addressing concerns regarding optimization by reducing lots of calls regarding star systems. \r\n> The update name is now changing, since the 'ARGON' update has concluded.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix: Tips panel -> No systems are highlighted on the map when explorer fleet move tip is
