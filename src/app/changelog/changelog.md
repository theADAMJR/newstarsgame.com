## 1.7.1 'GATEWAY' [26.06.2024]

### Added
- Add: Scroll Camera -> You can now move by hovering to corner of screen

### Improved
- Ubiquity -> Planet HUD -> World indicator shows colour of planet, rather than suitability for clarity
- System Name Text -> Planet HUD -> World indicator shows colour of planet, rather than suitability for clarity

### Optimized
- Events -> New event batching system that supposedly makes events run more efficiently

### Fixed

- Planet HUD -> World indicator is not shown until planet is fully explored

---

## 1.7.0 'GATEWAY' [22.03.2024]

### Improved
- Improve: Colony -> Add info to tooltip about migration for clarity.

### Optimized
- Optimize: Starbase Label HUD -> Should only update when siege progress changed, colony created, or month passed.

### Note: 'GATEWAY' Update
- The 'Meta' update mostly focused on multithreading monthly updates, and post early-access support.
- This update will continue this, but may largely focus on reducing daily lag spikes.
- Development may be a lot slower during this period, due to external events, so it may take a few months longer to complete NS to a full release standard.

---

## 1.6.3 'META' [07.03.2024]
> Animated combat fixes.

### Fixed
- Fix: Fleet -> After battles, fleets sometimes enter FTL in the middle of systems.
    -> When a fleet enters a battle, the order that was paused assumes the last position before the battle started, therefore ships appear to teleport out of nowhere, when resuming order, after battle ended.
- Fix: Seamless VFX -> Meteor VFX spawns while viewing system or ship builder.
- Fix: Ubiquity -> Animated Combat -> Projectile VFX is not scaled correctly.

### Tweaked
- Tweak: Combat System -> Increase pace of battles (damage effectiveness increased).

---

## 1.6.2 'META' [29.02.2024]
> Patch for inevitable combat bugs that were created from the pathfinding rework star system rescaling.

### Improved
- Improve: Ship Builder -> Toggling should re-open Ubiquity if it was previously open.

---

## 1.6.0-prerelease 'META' [23.02.2024]
> AI is now mostly multithreaded.

### Optimized
- Optimize: AI -> Colony and military calculations now use parallel processing.

### Tweaked
- Tweak: Cooperative Militarist -> Join Wars -> Can invite to wars when the recipient has an open attitude with the enemy, instead of cautious.

---

## 1.5.1 'META' [14.02.2024]
> Pushing previous beta update to all users.

---

## 1.5.1-prerelease 'META' [13.02.2024]
> Bug fixes and optimizations.

### Fixed
- Fix: Resource Manager -> Occupation cost shows without occupying starbases.
- Fix: Battle -> Retreat -> Sometimes retreats to systems with enemies in, meaning the battle continues.
- Fix: Load Save -> Does not update resource count.
- Fix: Agendas -> Opinion modification does result in correct values.

### Optimized
- Optimize: AI agendas and opinion calculations now use parallel processing.

---

## 1.5.0 'META' [09.02.2024]
> Over 2 weeks in the making. Reduction in monthly lag spikes with parallel optimization for AI, and saving.

### Optimized
- Optimize: Saving System -> Parallel optimization for saving, eliminating lag spikes from saving/auto-saving.
- Optimize: AI -> Parallel optimization for AI starbase, and diplomacy handling.
  - Diplomacy handling was the laggiest part of the AI.
  - Foundation added for further AI optimization.
  - There should now be a noticable reduction in monthly lag spikes.
- Optimize: Events -> Some non-critical events are no longer received, especially when the player is not involved, preventing lag.
  - Updates affected include: relations changed, colony orders, starbase orders, and fleet orders.

### Improved
- Improve: Tooltip -> Right-click to toggle pin tooltips in place.

### Fixed
- Fix: Animated Combat -> Ship movement was too slow when moving towards the target.
- Fix: Animated Combat -> Temporary workaround to allow random turrets to fire visually to fix turrets not appearing to fire when expected.
- Fix: Ubiquity -> Ships spawn out of bounds, on saves before `v1.3.0`.

### Changed

### Behind the Scenes
- Addition of e2e tests to improve stability.

### Note
- Save files before v1.3.0 (12th January 2024) previously have loaded fleets out of bounds, due to star system rescaling, but are now repositioned within the boundary.

---

## 1.4.0 'META' [25.01.2024]
> Pushing previous beta update to all users.

---

## 1.4.0-prerelease 'META' [22.01.2024]
> More optimizations, new galaxy sizes, and provisional removal of half-added features.

### Added
- Add: Map -> Map -> Duel map size - 50 stars galaxy.
- Add: Create Map -> Option to select duel stars galaxy map.
- Add: Create Map -> Recommended settings for duel stars galaxy map such as player count etc.

### Optimized
- Optimize: Resource Manager -> Reworked to use multithreading for most monthly resource calculations.
- Optimize: Pathfinding -> Reworked to use multithreading for calculating routes, to reduce lag spikes.
- Optimize: Fleet -> Eliminated large lag spikes when moving fleets (on modern CPUs).

### Fixed
- Fix: Start Game -> Does not open Ubiquity and spawns in the center of galaxy.
- Fix: Ubiquity -> Regular starbase labels appear huge.

### Changed
- Change: Resource Manager -> Space entity players no longer have resource calculations, reducing lag.
- Change: Map Generator -> Star counts for each map size are now `100`, `150`, `200`, `250`, `300` instead of `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500` for new games.
  - 400-500 stars is impractically large.
  - Double the smallest map size is too large of an increment.
  - Galaxy visuals were generally poor on map sizes of >300 stars.
  - Loading saves from old map sizes has been tested to work as normal.

### Removed
- Remove: Celestial Squid -> No longer spawns in galaxy, because it is currently too broken.
  - The celestial squid may appear again when more bug fixes and polishes have been done.
- Remove: Blue galaxy smoke from gold galaxy.

> Experimenting with running monthly calculations on multiple threads, to reduce lag spikes.

### Fixed
- Fix: Pop manager -> Population of clans does not increase.
- Fix: Ubiquity -> Opening a system is very laggy from new ship pathfinding system.

### Optimized
- Optimize: Pop manager -> Reworked to use multithreading for colony population calculations, which should slightly reduce monthly update lag.

---

## 1.3.0-prerelease 'META' [12.01.2024]
> Total redesign of ship movement, and rescaling of ubiquity star systems, focusing on fixing pathfinding bugs.

### Fixed

- Fix: Loading screen -> Some text appears to overflow their backgrounds.
- Fix: Combat system -> Ships collide with each other in combat.
- Fix: Ubiquity -> Space squids -> Beelines into planet roundabouts (so does fleet ubi position).
- Fix: Xeno Exterminator -> Raze Colony -> Multiple raze orders can be queued.

### Tweaked
- Tweak: Ubiquity -> Systems now always spawn at 0,0 instead of at a slight offset.

### Changed
- Change: Ubiquity -> Reduced size of star systems by 10x [due to limitations with new pathfinding system].
- Change: Ubiquity -> Starbases of unknown players no longer have empty HUDs.

## Note
> Following the post-release updates, there is a need for more careful and slower updates, like this one, deployed to the beta branch first.
> This update was delayed by a few days, since it was a huge rework and introduced many bugs that were internally fixed [20+ internally fixed bugs are omitted from the changelog].

*This will likely introduce some bugs I have not found, so the update will be deployed on the beta branch first to gather feedback. Sometimes a step backwards is required to take 2 steps forward.*

---

## 1.2.4 'META' [05.01.2024]
> Hotfix for colony siege not triggering, and some other fixes.

### Fixed
- Fix: Colony -> Siege -> Colony siege is sometimes not triggered [due to an issue with new fleet stats].

- Fix: Colony siege -> Civilian ships should not progress siege.
    - Siege progress is now determined by base damage, as opposed to ship strength.

## 1.2.0 'META' [28.12.2023]
> Backend simulated combat improvements, and animated combat fixes.

### Added
- Add: Solace ship builder -> Evasion stat into stats UI.
- Add: Combat system -> Use Solace turrets to deal damage in the backend.
- Add: Combat -> Min and max turret ranges.
- Add: Combat -> Rate of fire per turret.

### Improved
- Improve: Ship Builder -> Turrets -> Should have stats on screen, instead of tooltip [for clarity].

### Balanced
- Balance: Colonist -> Reduced from `75` to `45` power cost on standard speed.

### Fixed
- Fix: Ship builder -> Background has tiling artifacts on ultrawide displays.
- Fix: Solace ship builder -> When fleet types are unlocked, filter type UI does not update after opening the ship builder.

- Fix: Solace ship builder -> Panels remain open when opened.
- Fix: Starbase panel -> Upgrade button tooltip showed technological advance required when can upgrade starbase.
- Fix: Pause menu -> Game settings info is not fully visible on ultrawide aspect ratio.

### How Turret Ranges Currently Work
- When combat is being observed, accurate turret ranges are used from the animated ship position, otherwise if a star system is not open, turret range is based on the center of the fleet.
- This is because ship positions are not known by the server, only the client, as simulating positions on the server would be more difficult and require more CPU calls.

> Note: This combat update requires more work such as bug fixes/balancing/playtesting, but is functional, so will first be pushed to the beta branch.

---

## Changed

### Tweaks
- **Special resources are more equally distributed across the map.**
    - Void worlds now generate much more often, as antimatter was extremely rare.
    - Class O stars have a higher chance to spawn.
- **Most base resources have been increased from +5, to +10 per month.**
    - Momentum at the start of the game is now faster, as it took a while to get started previously.
- **Peaceful clans now have one agenda.**
    - This is so you can now meet conditions for open-borders with peaceful clans.
- **Colonists now take 180 days to build, instead of 60.**
    - Unless you are on the fastest game speed.
- **Game duration now affects logistical pacing.**
    - Time to build fleets or colony buildings is scaled based on duration.
    - Resource costs are not currently affected, although this may change.
    - Exploration is constant on all speeds.
- **Starter colonies, regardless of origin, start with an additional food building and 2 population.**
    - Like in Civilization, colony starvation is localized to the colony.
    - This means that if a colony has a food deficit it will slowly lose population.
    - The extra population ensures that food is produced immediately.
- **Each population uses 0.25 food instead of 1 food.**
    - This means each food building job supports 4 population.

## Fixed
- Crashing bugs with AI military performing weird shenanigans.
- Game lacked special abilities or unique playstyles (i.e. all governments were too similar).
- Colony building is unbalanced (numbers need tweaking).
- Fleets go hidden in wormhole systems.
- Star system simulation have some graphical issues (lighting, star graphical artifacts etc.) 
- Monthly updates are laggy and unoptimized, especially with AI.
- Simulated combat is inconsistent, and buggy.
- Seamless claims now fill correctly.
- **and hundreds more random bugs...**
